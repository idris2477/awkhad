Installation
============

It's assumed that for each expense sheet, the *payments* that are reconciled
with their *journal entry* were created and reconciled by the *Expense Tracker*
module automatically. Therefore, when this module is installed, these payments
will automatically be associated with said expense sheet so that they can be
deleted in case the expense sheet is canceled.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

#. Go to *Expenses -> My Expenses -> Expenses to Submit* and create a new
   *Expense* with *Employee (to reimburse)* checked on the field *Payment By*
#. Click on *Submit to Manager* button
#. Click on *Approve* button
#. Click on *Post Journal Entries* button
#. Click on *Register Payment* button, fill in the data of the wizard and
   click on *Validate* button
#. After that, the *Expense report* will have an associated journal entry
   reconciled with a payment
#. Click on *Cancel* button
#. The *Expense report* will be set to *Submitted* state; the journal entry and
   the payment will be deleted
