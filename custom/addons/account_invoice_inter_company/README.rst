Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to go to the menu *Settings > General Settings*, go to the tab *Multi-Companies* then check *Multi-companies*

You now have access to other checks *Common Product Catalog* and *Invoice Auto Validation*.

To customize products sharing don't hesitate to override `_compute_share_product()` in `res.company` model.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

 * This module cannot be fully used in combination with `remove_awkhad_entreprise` module. If you need both, uninstall `remove_awkhad_entreprise`, complete settings with `account_invoice_inter_company` and then re-install `remove_awkhad_entreprise`.
 * Product mapping: would be nice to have a matrix with the products on the left side and on the top row the companies.
